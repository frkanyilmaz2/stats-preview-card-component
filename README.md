## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned the power of "%". It uses the device width to adjust the element its specified for. I also learned to put an overlay to an element, an image in this example.


### Continued development

I need to get better at responsive design. When I adjust the screen size, the left row keeps its ratio but right row just keeps getting smaller in itself while its container size stays still.
